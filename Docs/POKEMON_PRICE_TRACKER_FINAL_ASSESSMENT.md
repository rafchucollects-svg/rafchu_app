### The response structure doesn't even have placeholders for graded data.

## 🔍 EVERYTHING I TESTED

|-------------------|--------|
| `/api/v2/cards` | ✅ Works (English cards only) |
| `/api/v2/sets` | ✅ Works (English sets only) |
| `/api/v2/sealed-products` | ✅ Works (pricing available) |
| `/api/v2/cards?includeHistory=true` | ✅ Works (30-90 day history) |
| `/api/v2/cards?includeEbay=true` | ❌ Returns `"ebayData": false` in metadata |
| `/api/v2/cards?includeGraded=true` | ❌ No effect |
| `/api/v2/cards?includePSA=true` | ❌ No effect |

## 🎯 THE DISCONNECT

### Their Documentation Says:
> "PSA grading data (8/9/10), price history up to 90 days, all card metadata (set, rarity, type), high-resolution card images, and **eBay sales data for graded cards**."

### What Their API Actually Provides:
- English card pricing ✅
- Historical pricing (30-90 days) ✅
- Sealed products ✅
- Multiple conditions (NM/LP/MP/DMG) ✅
- **NO graded/PSA data** ❌
- **NO eBay data** ❌
- **NO Japanese cards** ❌

---

## 💡 POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS

### 1. **Website Feature vs API Feature**
- The Pokemon Price Tracker **website** may have PSA grading calculators
- But the **API** doesn't expose that data
- Discord users might be talking about website features, not API features

### 2. **API Tier Difference**
- **Your Plan:** Pro ($49.99/mo or similar)
- **Higher Plan:** API tier (100,000 calls/day, $price unknown)
- Graded data might be an "API tier" exclusive feature

### 3. **Coming Soon™**
- Documentation written for planned features not yet released
- They're actively developing it
- Will be added in future API updates

### 4. **Different Data Source**
- Their website scrapes PSA/eBay directly
- API only provides TCGPlayer data (which doesn't have graded pricing)
- Graded data too expensive/complex to expose via API

---

## 🎤 RECOMMENDED: ASK THEIR DISCORD

**Draft Message:**

> Hey team! 👋
>
> I have a **Pro API subscription** and I'm trying to access graded card data (PSA 8/9/10, eBay sales, etc.).
>
> **What I'm seeing:**
> - Using `/api/v2/cards?includeEbay=true`
> - Getting `"ebayData": false` in metadata
> - No `gradedPrices` or `psaData` fields in response
>
> **Questions:**
> 1. Is graded/PSA data available via the API, or only on the website?
> 2. Do I need to upgrade to the "API tier" for that?
> 3. Is there a specific endpoint or parameter I should use?
>
> My use case: Building a Pokemon card app that needs graded card pricing for investment features.
>
> Thanks! 🙏

## 📋 YOUR OPTIONS

### Option A: Use What Works + Add Other APIs
**Pros:**
- Start building NOW with English cards
- Add sealed products support NOW
- Use TCGAPIs or PSA API for graded data later

**Cons:**
- Need to integrate multiple APIs
- More complexity
- Possible cost increase

---

### Option B: Wait for Clarification
**Pros:**
- Might discover Pro tier has graded data somehow
- Might learn of hidden endpoint
- Could save money if it's included

**Cons:**
- Delays your project
- Might find out it's not available anyway

---

### Option C: Upgrade to "API Tier"
**Pros:**
- Might unlock graded data
- Higher rate limits (100k/day)

**Cons:**
- Unknown cost (could be $200+/mo)
- Still might not have graded data
- Overkill if you don't need 100k calls/day

---

## 🚀 MY RECOMMENDATION

**Do This NOW:**
1. **Ask in Discord** (use the message above)
2. **Start building** with what works:
   - English card pricing ✅
   - Sealed products ✅
   - Historical data ✅

**Do This LATER** (after Discord response):
- If they have graded data → upgrade or use hidden endpoint
- If they don't → integrate TCGAPIs for graded ($20-50/mo)
- Add PokemonTCG.io for Japanese cards (free)

**This approach:**
- ✅ Gets you shipping features TODAY
- ✅ Doesn't block your progress
- ✅ Minimizes wasted time waiting
- ✅ Gives you real data to make decisions

## 📞 NEXT STEPS

Want me to:
1. **Draft a Discord message** for you to send?
2. **Start integrating what works** (English cards + sealed products)?
3. **Research TCGAPIs pricing** for graded cards as backup?
4. **All of the above**?

Let me know! 🎮
